    abstract     = "When writing transformation systems, a significant amount of engineering effort goes into setting up the infrastructure
                   needed to direct individual transformations to specific targets in the data being transformed.  Strategic and generic
                   programming languages provide general-purpose infrastructure for this task, which the author of a transformation system
                   can use for any algebraic data structure.

                   The Kansas University Rewrite Engine (KURE) is a typed strategic programming language, implemented as a Haskell-embedded
                   domain-specific language.  Or, viewed from another perspective, KURE is a Haskell library for generic programming.  KURE
                   is designed to support typed transformations over typed data, and the main challenge is how to make such transformations
                   compatible with generic traversal strategies that should operate over any type.  Compared to other Haskell libraries for
                   generic programming that provide such type support, the distinguishing feature of KURE's solution is that the user can
                   configure the behavior of traversals based on the location of each datum in the tree, beyond their behavior being
                   determined by the type of each datum.

                   This article describes KURE's approach to assigning types to generic traversals, and the implementation of that
                   approach.  We also compare KURE, its design choices, and their consequences, with other approaches to strategic and
                   generic programming."

abstract={Sunroof is a Haskell-hosted Domain Specific Language (DSL)
                  for generating JavaScript. The central feature of
                  Sunroof is a JavaScript monad, which, like the
                  Haskell IO-monad, allows access to external
                  resources, but specifically JavaScript resources. As
                  such, Sunroof is primarily a feature-rich
                  foreign-function API to the browser’s JavaScript
                  engine, and all the browser-specific functionality,
                  including HTML-based rendering, event handling, and
                  drawing to the HTML5 canvas element.

                  In this paper,
                  we give the design and implementation of
                  Sunroof. Using monadic reification, we generate
                  JavaScript from a deep embedding of the JavaScript
                  monad. The Sunroof DSL has the feel of native
                  Haskell, with a simple Haskell-based type schema to
                  guide the Sunroof programmer. Furthermore, because
                  we are generating code, we can offer Haskell-style
                  concurrency patterns, such as MVars and Channels. In
                  combination with a web-services package, the Sunroof
                  DSL offers a robust platform to build interactive
                  web applications.}

This is a serious limitation, as concatMap represents computations on nested streams. The original implementation of Stream Fusion used the Glasgow Haskell Compiler’s user-directed rewriting system. A transformation which allows the compiler to fuse many uses of concatMap has previously been proposed, but never implemented, because the host rewrite system was not expressive enough to implement the proposed transformation. In this paper, we develop a custom optimization plugin which implements the proposed concatMap transformation, and study the effectiveness of the transformation in practice. We also provide a new translation scheme for list comprehensions which enables them to be optimized. Within this framework, we extend the transformation to monadic streams. Code featuring uses of concatMap experiences significant speedup when compiled with this optimization. This allows Stream Fusion to outperform its rival, foldr/build, on many list computations, and enables performance-sensitive code to be expressed at a higher level of abstraction."

Generic traversals in SYB are about an order of magnitude slower than equivalent handwritten, non-generic traversals. Thus while SYB allows the concise expression of many traversals, its use incurs a significant runtime cost. Existing techniques for optimizing other generic-programming systems are not able to eliminate this overhead.

This paper presents an optimization that completely eliminates this cost. The optimization takes advantage of domain-specific knowledge about the structure of SYB and in so doing can optimize SYB-style traversals to be as fast as handwritten, non-generic code.

This paper presents both the formal structure of the optimization and the results of benchmarking the optimized SYB code against both unoptimized SYB code and handwritten, non-generic code. In these benchmarks, the optimized SYB code matches the performance of handwritten code even when the unoptimized SYB code is an order of magnitude or more slower."

we overview the design and implementation of the second generation

Driven by the needs and experiences

we have made a number of improvements to both the external API

We have retained our dual shallow/deep
representation of signals in general, but now have a number of externally visible
abstractions for combinatorial and sequential circuits, and enabled signals.
We introduce these abstractions, as well as our abstractions for
reading and writing memory.
Internally, we found the need to represent unknown values inside our circuits,
so we made aggressive use of associated type families to lift our values in a principled
and regular way. We discuss this design decision, how it unfortunately
complicates the internals of Kansas Lava, and how
we mitigate this complexity.
Finally, when connecting Kansas Lava to the real world,
the standardized idiom of using named input and output ports
is provided by Kansas Lava using a new monad, called \verb|Fabric|.
We present the design of this Fabric monad, and
illustrate its use in a small but complete example.}

language for strategic programming specialized to GHC's core
language, a library of primitive rewrites, and a shell-style--based
scripting language for interactive and batch usage.

There are many program transformation techniques that have been
described in the literature but have not been mechanized and made
available inside GHC --- either because they are too specialized to
include in a general-purpose compiler, or because the developers'
interest is in theory rather than implementation. The mechanization
process can often reveal pragmatic obstacles that are glossed over in
pen-and-paper proofs; understanding and removing these obstacles is our
concern. Using HERMIT, we implement eleven examples of three program
transformations, report on our experience, and describe improvements
made in the process."

To develop our ideas, we have implemented HERMIT, a toolkit enabling

With HERMIT, users can experiment with optimizations
and equational reasoning, while the
tedious heavy lifting of performing the actual transformations
is done for them.

HERMIT provides a transformation API that can be
used to build higher-level rewrite tools.
One use-case is
prototyping new optimizations as clients of this API
before being committed to the GHC toolchain.
We describe a HERMIT application---a
read-eval-print shell for performing transformations using HERMIT.
We also demonstrate using this shell to prototype an optimization
on a specific example, and report our initial experiences and
remaining challenges.",

providing a standardized cross-platform API.
However, Javascript is a client-side scripting language, and
a traditional shallow, foreign-function-call style Haskell
interface to the client does not scale well because calling a
Javascript command involves sending the command, and optionally waiting for a response, over a network.
Instead, we build a deep embedding of Javascript commands inside a Javascript monad.
Along with supporting web-based infrastructure,

Current functional programming practice prefers general types over exact types

programs would require numerous similar data types and conversions between
them.
We factor out a pattern in such conversions as a reusable Haskell function. We
extend existing generic programming techniques to define it and to use it
without introducing undue obfuscation.
Our reusable function eliminates the boilerplate for conversions between the
numerous exact types. It therefore delivers the benefits of exact types and
simulates the reusability of general types with lightweight generic
programming.
We demonstrate our function by using it to define a lambda-lifting function
with an exact range type that has no constructor for lambdas.}

                  co-design. Using examples, we will show how
                  generative techniques, high-level interfaces, and
                  refinement techniques like the worker/wrapper
                  transformation can be used to take descriptions of
                  specialized computation, and generate efficient
                  circuits. Kansas Lava, our high-level hardware
                  description language built on top of the functional
                  language Haskell, acts as a bridge between these
                  computational descriptions and synthesizable
                  VHDL. Central to the whole approach is the use of
                  Haskell types to express communication and timing
                  choices between computational components. Design
                  choices and engineering compromises during co-design
                  become type-centric refinements, encouraging
                  architectural exploration. }

implement the virtual machine along with a controller program to manipulate
the satellite{\textquoteright}s behavior. In this paper, we describe the modeling of the
simulation environment, with a focus on the compilation and testing
infrastructure for the generated binaries for this virtual machine. This
infrastructure makes novel use of an implementation of a deeply embedded
Domain Specific Language (DSL) within Haskell.  In particular, with use of
IO-based observable sharing, it was straightforward for a function to be both
an executable specification as well as a portable implementation,
and because of this the rendered binary was found to be robust and reliable.},

        traditional stop-examine-continue model of online debugging, which is
        simple and intuitive, but has traditionally been shunned in the
        context of Haskell because it exposes the lazy evaluation order.  We

        The design focuses on availability: our debugger is intended
        to work on all programs that can be compiled with GHC, and without
        requiring the programmer to jump through additional hoops to debug
        their program.  The debugger has a novel approach for reconstructing

  abstract      = {When an Automated Testing Equipment (ATE) company
          designs a new system, the issue of backward compatibility is
          always a major concern, both for the company and its
          customers. If backward compatibility is maintained, the ATE
          application engineers face the difficult task of trying to
          support new features on an aging system. The alternative is
          to face the problem of converting old test programs to the
          new environment. Translation of legacy code involves an
          automatic translation tool, and some application effort
          applied to those problems the translator couldn't
          resolve. To minimize the amount of work required from the
          application engineers, the tool needs to be
          semantically aware; that is, the tool must contain
          domain specific knowledge and use that knowledge when
          translating. The more knowledge a tool has at its disposal,
          the less code an application engineer is forced to translate
          by hand.

          Until recently, it has been difficult to perform automatic
          translation satisfactorily because it was not cost effective
          to write a translator that possessed such semantic
          understanding of the test programs. By making good use of
          Functional Programming techniques and tools, we were able to
          construct a cost effective, semantically aware translation
          tool in a fraction of the time needed by traditional
          methods. Based upon its performance during testing, we
          believe the tool to correctly translate the majority of
          test programs, thereby greatly easing the applications
          engineers' burden.},

	  often used as ''glue'' to connect separate parts of a program
	  together. Deforestation is the process of automatically removing
	  intermediate data structures. In this thesis we present and analyse a
	  new approach to deforestation. This new approach is both practical and
	  general.

	  We analyse in detail the problem of list removal rather than
	  the more general problem of arbitrary data structure removal. This
	  more limited scope allows a complete evaluation of the pragmatic
	  aspects of using our deforestation technology.

	  We have implemented our list deforestation algorithm in the
	  Glasgow Haskell compiler. Our implementation has allowed
	  practical feedback. One important conclusion is that a new
	  analysis is required to infer function arities and the
	  linearity of lambda abstractions. This analysis renders the
	  basic deforestation algorithm far more effective.

	  We give a detailed assessment of our implementation of
	  deforestation. We measure the effectiveness of our
	  deforestation on a suite of real application programs. We
	  also observe the costs of our deforestation algorithm.}

    abstract     = "The code compiled from a non-strict functional program usually manipulates heap-allocated boxed numbers. Compilers for such languages often go to considerable trouble to optimise operations on boxed numbers into simpler operations on their unboxed forms. These optimisations are usually handled in an ad hoc manner in the code generator, because earlier phases of the compiler have no way to talk about unboxed values. We present a new approach, which makes unboxed values into (nearly) first-class citizens. The language, including its type system, is extended to handle unboxed values. The optimisation of boxing and unboxing operations can now be reinterpreted as a set of correctness-preserving program transformations. Indeed the particular transformations required are ones which a compiler would want to implement anyway. The compiler becomes both simpler and more modular. Two other benefits accrue. Firstly, the results of strictness analysis can be exploited within the same uniform transformational framework. Secondly, new algebraic data types with unboxed components can be declared. Values of these types can be manipulated much more efficiently than the corresponding boxed versions. Both a static and a dynamic semantics are given for the augmented language. The denotational dynamic semantics is notable for its use of unpointed domains."

It has been used by compiler writers for many years, but the technique is little-known in the wider functional programming community, and has never been described precisely. In this article we explain, formalise, and explore the generality of the worker/wrapper transformation. We also provide a systematic recipe for its use as an equational reasoning technique for improving the performance of programs, and illustrate the power of this recipe using a range of examples.},

@inproceedings{PeytonJones:99:weakptrs,
	Abstract = {Every now and then, a user of the Glasgow Haskell
Compiler asks for a feature that requires specialised support from the
storage manager.  Memo functions, pointer equality, external pointers,
finalizers, and weak pointers, are all examples.

We take memo functions as our exemplar because they turn out to be the
trickiest to support.  We present no fewer than four distinct
mechanisms that are needed to support memo tables, and that (in
various combinations) satisfy a variety of other needs.

The resulting set of primitives is undoubtedly powerful and useful.
Whether they are {\em too} powerful is not yet clear.  While the focus
of our discussion is on Haskell, there is nothing Haskell-specific
about most of the primitives, which could readily be used in other
settings.

	Abstract = {The semantics of C is described in the ANSI/ISO standard using
natural language. This
paper contains a brief summary, more descriptive than technical, of
our research in specifying
a complete and accurate formal semantics for ANSI C. We follow the
denotational
approach and divide the specification in three distinct phases:
static, typing and dynamic
semantics. Moreover, we have developed a direct implementation of the
semantics, using
the programming language Haskell. We argue that our formal
specification results in a better
understanding of the semantics of ANSI C and comment on its
readability, precision,
abstraction and applications.},

  structures. It focuses on the problem where a programmer wants to
  operate only on a small subset of the datatype, leaving a large

  first class object and uses the record syntax to replace specific
  elements of the algebra. This leads to definition of some algebra
  combinators. The authors spend a fair amount of time analyzing ways
  to combine monadic algebras.

This work operates on a recursively
  defined datatype, not using the functorized version as found in
  Duponcheel and Gayo's work.}},

We have taken a pragmatic approach: the debugger is based on the traditional stop-examine-continue model of online debugging, which is simple and intuitive, but has traditionally been shunned in the context of Haskell because it exposes the lazy evaluation order. We argue that this drawback is not as severe as it may seem, and in some cases is an advantage. The design focuses on availability: our debugger is intended to work on all programs that can be compiled with GHC, and without requiring the programmer to jump through additional hoops to debug their program. The debugger has a novel approach for reconstructing the type of runtime values in a polymorphic context. Our implementation is light on complexity, and was integrated into GHC without significant upheaval.},

	abstract = {When an Automated Testing Equipment (ATE) company designs a new system, the issue of backward compatibility is always a major concern, both for the company and its customers. If backward compatibility is maintained, the ATE application engineers face the difficult task of trying to support new features on an aging system. The alternative is to face the problem of converting old test programs to the new environment. Translation of legacy code involves an automatic translation tool, and some application effort applied to those problems the translator couldn{\textquoteright}t resolve. To minimize the amount of work required from the application engineers, the tool needs to be semantically aware; that is, the tool must contain domain specific knowledge and use that knowledge when translating. The more knowledge a tool has at its disposal, the less code an application engineer is forced to translate by hand. Until recently, it has been difficult to perform automatic translation satisfactorily because it was not cost effective to write a translator that possessed such semantic understanding of the test programs. By making good use of Functional Programming techniques and tools, we were able to construct a cost effective, semantically aware translation tool in a fraction of the time needed by traditional methods. Based upon its performance during testing, we believe the tool to correctly translate the majority of test programs, thereby greatly easing the applications engineers{\textquoteright} burden.},

Every story should have a beginning, a middle, and an end.
We argue that this advice leads to a simple and useful idiom for
creating an animation Domain Specific Language (DSL).
We introduce our animation DSL, and show how it captures the concept
of beginning, middle, and end inside a Haskell applicative functor we call Active.
We have an implementation of our DSL inside the image generation
accelerator, ChalkBoard, and we use our DSL on an extended example,
animating a visual demonstration of the Pythagorean Theorem.

y a runtime penalty for this generality. This is achieved through concise, carefully-designed language extension
s that support runtime code generation and program execution. Additionally, type systems for MSP languages are d
esigned to statically ensure that dynamically generated programs are type-safe, and therefore require no type ch
ecking after they are generated. This hands-on tutorial is aimed at the reader interested in learning the basics
 of MSP practice. The tutorial uses a freely available MSP extension of OCaml called MetaOCaml, and presents a d
etailed analysis of the issues that arise in staging an interpreter for a small programming language. The tutori
al concludes with pointers to various resources that can be used to probe further into related topics.},

abstract={ It is common wisdom that synthesizing hardware from higher-level descriptions than Verilog incurs a performance penalty. The case study here shows that this need not be the case. If the higher-level language has suitable semantics, it is possible to synthesize hardware that is competitive with hand-written Verilog RTL. Differences in the hardware quality are dominated by architecture differences and, therefore, it is more important to explore multiple hardware architectures. This exploration is not practical without quality synthesis from higher-level languages.},
